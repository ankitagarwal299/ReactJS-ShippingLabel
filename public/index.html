    <h1>Shipping Label Creator</h1>
    <p>
      You will be creating an app that a shipper might use to generate
      hypothetical shipping label for the FormationPost courier service. This
      project doesn’t generate real labels and shouldn’t use any UPS, FedEx,
      etc... APIs. It is just an exercise in building forms to accept user
      input, and rendering a UI meeting more stringent requirements of this
      hypothetical shipping label. Read the features carefully.
    </p>
    <h2>Mocks</h2>

    Here’s an example of what the page might look like:<br />

    <h2>Guide</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Plan your Components</b><br />Identify which components you need, as
        well as the props and state for those components.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Create the Forms</b><br />Create a form component to accept the
        sender information. Make sure your state doesn’t get too complicated
        when storing all this data: 1. Name 2. Address (street, city, state, zip
        code). You should store these fields in individual components. Reuse the
        form to accept the recipient information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Create the UUID</b><br />Generate a unique shipping tracking number
        based on a UUID. If you are not familiar with UUIDs don’t worry! Try to
        find libraries on npm to get the results needed, and research more later
        about how they work. <br />1. Generate a UUID in V4 format using a
        library on npm to help. e.g. 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000<br />2.
        Convert the UUID to base64 format using a library on npm to help e.g.
        convert cdaed56d-8712-414d-b346-01905d0026fe to za7VbYcSQU2zRgGQXQAm/g==
        <br />3. Use the resulting string as the ‘tracking number’
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Render the Shipping Label</b><br />Render a shipping label containing
        all of this information as show in the mocks above. 1. Use a library on
        npm to render the QR Code. The QR code should be generated directly from
        the string tracking number created in step 3. 2. It’s important that the
        label look exactly like the mock or the label might be rejected from
        FormationPost.
